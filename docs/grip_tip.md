## Fingertips for Better Grip

We've added a small but useful feature to the fingertip design in the [Onshape model](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/96518c699fd03eea508b06d3/w/d5f95a6266b027d84ae48634/e/e41e675b82a4f671f01336e0), making it easier to improve grip performance.

### Flat Tip Design for Adhesive Grip Layers

The tip of the finger can be **flattened**, allowing you to:
- Cut the same shape from the **adhesive or anti-slip material** of your choice
- Stick it onto the fingertip
- **Fold the side flaps** neatly around the edges

To secure the folded flaps in place, you can add a **thin strip of tape or band** around the perimeter of the tip. This helps maintain a clean and durable finish.

### Best Performing Material So Far: **3M GM400**

After testing various grip-enhancing materials, our favorite so far is the **3M GM400**

- Strong **dry adhesion** (not sticky, but highly grippy)
- Excellent **friction**, even on smooth objects
- Durable and **wear-resistant**, sticks well
- Easy to cut and apply

However, the cost is quite high and the quantity is probably too much for just covering one gripper tip...

> ⚠️ _Note: We have **no affiliation with 3M** — this is an objective recommendation based on hands-on testing._


### TPU Option – Deformable but Solid

You can also 3D print the fingertips in **TPU** with a **moderate infill (30–50%)**, resulting in:
- A flexible structure that adapts to object shapes
- Enough rigidity to preserve form and control

Combining TPU with an adhesive grip layer offers a great balance between **compliance and friction**.

### Personal Preference: Rigid Base + Grip Layer

While TPU works well, **our personal preference** is to use a **rigid tip (PLA or PETG)** and simply add a **thin rubber-like or anti-slip layer** (such as GM400) on top.  
This approach avoids unwanted deformation, while still ensuring **strong and reliable grip** — especially useful when precise, repeatable grasps are needed.


Feel free to experiment with different grip materials — the flat tip shape makes it easy to try out and swap alternatives depending on your use case or your budget.
